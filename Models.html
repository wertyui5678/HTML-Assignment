          <tr>
            <td>2025 Aston Martin Vanquish</td>
            <td>Very sleek and clean design with an amazing interior. The only thing holding it back from the top spot is that the number one spot is even more impressive.</td>
            <td>Not very influential yet, but it is growing in popularity.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>2024 Rolls-Royce Phantom</td>
            <td>Definitely a nice car that many would love to own. However, the design is a little bit too tame for our liking.</td>
            <td>The design is quite nice, especially the leather seats and the stylish bumper.</td>
            <td align="center">3rd place</td>

          <tr>
            <td>2025 BMW 7-Series / i7</td>
            <td>This car is great and one of our favorites, but in comparison to the other vehicles it’s not so spectacular.</td>
            <td>Very influential. It's seen in countless films and mentioned in lots of literature.</td>
            <td align="center">4th place</td>

          <tr>
            <td>2025 Audi A8 / S8</td>

          <tr>
            <td>2024 Lexus LS</td>
            <td>This car isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but in comparison to the rest of the cars on this list it is unimpressive, leading to its position in last place.</td>
            <td>The design is pretty bland, but there is beauty in simplicity and this car proves that.</td>
            <td align="center">5th place</td>
